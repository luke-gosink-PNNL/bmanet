	Annote = {A glutamic acid was buried in the hydrophobic core of staphylococcal nuclease by replacement of Val-66. Its pKa was measured with equilibrium thermodynamic methods. It was 4.3 units higher than the pKa of Glu in water. This increase was comparable to the ΔpKa of 4.9 units measured previously for a lysine buried at the same location. According to the Born formalism these ΔpKa are energetically equivalent to the transfer of a charged group from water to a medium of dielectric constant of 12. In contrast, the static dielectric constants of dry protein powders range from 2 to 4. In the crystallographic structure of the V66E mutant, a chain of water molecules was seen that hydrates the buried Glu-66 and links it with bulk solvent. The buried water molecules have never previously been detected in {$>$}20 structures of nuclease. The structure and the measured energetics constitute compelling and unprecedented experimental evidence that solvent penetration can contribute significantly to the high apparent polarizability inside proteins. To improve structure-based calculations of electrostatic effects with continuum methods, it will be necessary to learn to account quantitatively for the contributions by solvent penetration to dielectric effects in the protein interior.},

	Abstract = {The validity of the Poisson--Boltzmann (PB) equation is reconsidered on the basis of functional expansion techniques supplemented by the mean spherical approximation. In the application of greatest interest a strong Coulomb potential originating in an external source, such as a polyelectrolyte molecule, acts on a salt solution of small mobile ions. Where the local charge density of mobile ions is high, substantial errors may occur in the PB approximation that relates charge density to mean potential. However, the solution to the PB equation is nevertheless a good approximation in the indicated application because a quite small percentage change in the electrostatic potential can compensate large errors in the Boltzmann distribution. An application to DNA illustrates this compensation, and also its impending failure at bulk salt concentrations in excess of 0.1M. A two phase (or condensation) model is derived as an approximation to the PB equation and retains fair accuracy even at substantial salt concentrations, where the limiting laws lose theoretical validity.},

A database of atomic electrostatic environments and molecular electrostatic solvation free energies comprising amino acid residues, nucleic acid bases, dipeptides, dinucleotides, proteins, and DNA strands is established, and numerical finite difference Poisson calculations are solved using atomic radii and charges from the corresponding force field parameters. These data provide the necessary input to parametrize generalized {Born} models for a particular force field. The performance of these models in reproducing overall molecular solvation trends is examined and found to be quite good. Furthermore, calculations of electrostatic solvation free energy differences suggest that conformational free energy changes are well reproduced. Finally, the utilization of this generalized {Born} model in molecular dynamics simulations (both with and without cutoffs) is shown to give excellent agreement with explicit solvent simulations of a small 56-residue protein in water.},

@article{Bell-Upp:2011,
	Abstract = {The general thermodynamic principles behind pH driven conformational transitions of biological macromolecules are well understood. What is less obvious is how they can be used to engineer pH switches in proteins. The acid unfolding of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) was used to illustrate different factors that can affect pH-driven conformational transitions. Acid unfolding is a structural transition driven by preferential H+ binding to the acid unfolded state (U) over the native (N) state of a protein. It is the result of carboxylic groups that titrate with more normal pKa values in the U state than in the N state. Acid unfolding profiles of proteins reflect a balance between electrostatic and non-electrostatic contributions to stability. Several strategies were used in attempts to turn SNase into an acid insensitive protein: (1) enhancing global stability of the protein with mutagenesis or with osmolytes, (2) use of high salt concentrations to screen Coulomb interactions, (3) stabilizing the N state through specific anion effects, (4) removing Asp or Glu residues that titrate with depressed pKa values in the N state, and (5) removing basic residues that might have strong repulsive interactions in the N state at low pH. The only effective way to engineer acid resistance in SNase is not through modulation of pKa values of Asp/Glu but by enhancing the global stability of the protein. Modulation of pH-driven conformational transitions by selective manipulation of the electrostatic component of the switch is an extremely difficult undertaking.},

@article{Harms:2009,
	Abstract = {The {p$K_a$} values of internal ionizable groups are usually very different from the normal {p$K_a$} values of ionizable groups in water. To examine the molecular determinants of {p$K_a$} values of internal groups, we compared the properties of Lys, Asp, and Glu at internal position 38 in staphylococcal nuclease. Lys38 titrates with a normal or elevated {p$K_a$}, whereas Asp38 and Glu38 titrate with elevated {p$K_a$} values of 7.0 and 7.2, respectively. In the structure of the L38K variant, the buried amino group of the Lys38 side chain makes an ion pair with Glu122, whereas in the structure of the L38E variant, the buried carboxyl group of Glu38 interacts with two backbone amides and has several nearby carboxyl oxygen atoms. Previously, we showed that the {p$K_a$} of Lys38 is normal owing to structural reorganization and water penetration concomitant with ionization of the Lys side chain. In contrast, the {p$K_a$} values of Asp38 and Glu38 are perturbed significantly owing to an imbalance between favorable polar interactions and unfavorable contributions from dehydration and from Coulomb interactions with surface carboxylic groups. Their ionization is also coupled to subtle structural reorganization. These results illustrate the complex interplay between local polarity, Coulomb interactions, and structural reorganization as determinants of {p$K_a$} values of internal groups in proteins. This study suggests that improvements to computational methods for {p$K_a$} calculations will require explicit treatment of the conformational reorganization that can occur when internal groups ionize.},

@article{Chimenti:2011,
	Abstract = {The side chains of Lys66, Asp66, and Glu66 in staphylococcal nuclease are fully buried and surrounded mainly by hydrophobic matter, except for internal water molecules associated with carboxylic oxygen atoms. These ionizable side chains titrate with pKa values of 5.7, 8.8, and 8.9, respectively. To reproduce these pKa values with continuum electrostatics calculations, we treated the protein with high dielectric constants. We have examined the structural origins of these high apparent dielectric constants by using NMR spectroscopy to characterize the structural response to the ionization of these internal side chains. Substitution of Val66 with Lys66 and Asp66 led to increased conformational fluctuations of the microenvironments surrounding these groups, even under pH conditions where Lys66 and Asp66 are neutral. When Lys66, Asp66, and Glu66 are charged, the proteins remain almost fully folded, but resonances for a few backbone amides adjacent to the internal ionizable residues are broadened. This suggests that the ionization of the internal groups promotes a local increase in dynamics on the intermediate timescale, consistent with either partial unfolding or increased backbone fluctuations of helix 1 near residue 66, or, less likely, with increased fluctuations of the charged side chains at position 66. These experiments confirm that the high apparent dielectric constants reported by internal Lys66, Asp66, and Glu66 reflect localized changes in conformational fluctuations without incurring detectable global structural reorganization. To improve structure-based pKa calculations in proteins, we will need to learn how to treat this coupling between ionization of internal groups and local changes in conformational fluctuations explicitly.},

	Abstract = {The dielectric properties of proteins are poorly understood and difficult to describe quantitatively. This limits the accuracy of methods for structure-based calculation of electrostatic energies and pKa values. The pKa values of many internal groups report apparent protein dielectric constants of 10 or higher. These values are substantially higher than the dielectric constants of 2{{\^a}}4 measured experimentally with dry proteins. The structural origins of these high apparent dielectric constants are not well understood. Here we report on structural and equilibrium thermodynamic studies of the effects of pH on the V66D variant of staphylococcal nuclease. In a crystal structure of this protein the neutral side chain of Asp-66 is buried in the hydrophobic core of the protein and hydrated by internal water molecules. Asp-66 titrates with a pKa value near 9. A decrease in the far UV-CD signal was observed, concomitant with ionization of this aspartic acid, and consistent with the loss of 1.5 turns of -helix. These data suggest that the protein dielectric constant needed to reproduce the pKa value of Asp-66 with continuum electrostatics calculations is high because the dielectric constant has to capture, implicitly, the energetic consequences of the structural reorganization that are not treated explicitly in continuum calculations with static structures.},

	Abstract = {10.1073/pnas.0805113105 Internal ionizable groups are quite rare in water-soluble globular proteins. Presumably, this reflects the incompatibility between charges and the hydrophobic environment in the protein interior. Here we show that proteins can have an inherently high tolerance for internal ionizable groups. The 25 internal positions in staphylococcal nuclease were substituted one at a time with Lys, Glu, or Asp without abolishing enzymatic activity and without detectable changes in the conformation of the protein. Similar results with substitutions of 6 randomly chosen internal positions in ribonuclease H with Lys and Glu suggest that the ability of proteins to tolerate internal ionizable groups might be a property common to many proteins. Eighty-six of the 87 substitutions made were destabilizing, but in all but one case the proteins remained in the native state at neutral pH. By comparing the stability of each variant protein at two different pH values it was established that the p values of most of the internal ionizable groups are shifted; many of the internal ionizable groups are probably neutral at physiological pH values. These studies demonstrate that special structural adaptations are not needed for ionizable groups to exist stably in the hydrophobic interior of proteins. The studies suggest that enzymes and other proteins that use internal ionizable groups for functional purposes could have evolved through the random accumulation of mutations that introduced ionizable groups at internal positions, followed by evolutionary adaptation and optimization to modulate stability, dynamics, and other factors necessary for function.},

	Annote = {Lys-66 and Glu-66, buried in the hydrophobic interior of staphylococcal nuclease by mutagenesis, titrate with pKa values of 5.7 and 8.8, respectively (Dwyer et al., 2000, Biophys. J. 79:1610--1620; Garc{\'\i}a-Moreno E. et al., 1997, Biophys. Chem. 64:211--224). Continuum calculations with static structures reproduced the pKa values when the protein interior was treated with a dielectric constant (ϵin) of 10. This high apparent polarizability can be rationalized in the case of Glu-66 in terms of internal water molecules, visible in crystallographic structures, hydrogen bonded to Glu-66. The water molecules are absent in structures with Lys-66; the high polarizability cannot be reconciled with the hydrophobic environment surrounding Lys-66. Equilibrium thermodynamic experiments showed that the Lys-66 mutant remained folded and native-like after ionization of the buried lysine. The high polarizability must therefore reflect water penetration, minor local structural rearrangement, or both. When in pKa calculations with continuum methods, the internal water molecules were treated explicitly, and allowed to relax in the field of the buried charged group, the pKa values of buried residues were reproduced with ϵin in the range 4--5. The calculations show that internal waters can modulate pKa values of buried residues effectively, and they support the hypothesis that the buried Lys-66 is in contact with internal waters even though these are not seen crystallographically. When only the one or two innermost water molecules were treated explicitly, ϵin of 5--7 reproduced the pKa values. These values of ϵin {$>$} 4 imply that some conformational reorganization occurs concomitant with the ionization of the buried groups.},

	Abstract = {His121 and His124 are embedded in a network of polar and ionizable groups on the surface of staphylococcal nuclease. To examine how membership in a network affects the electrostatic properties of ionizable groups, the tautomeric state and the pKa values of these histidines were measured with NMR spectroscopy in the wild-type nuclease and in 13 variants designed to disrupt the network. In the background protein, His121 and His124 titrate with pKa values of 5.2 and 5.6, respectively. In the variants, where the network was disrupted, the pKa values range from 4.03 to 6.46 for His121, and 5.04 to 5.99 for His124. The largest decrease in a pKa was observed when the favorable Coulomb interaction between His121 and Glu75 was eliminated; the largest increase was observed when Tyr91 or Tyr93 was substituted with Ala or Phe. In all variants, the dominant tautomeric state at neutral pH was the Nε2 state. At one level the network behaves as a rigid unit that does not readily reorganize when disrupted: crystal structures of the E75A or E75Q variants show that even when the pivotal Glu75 is removed, the overall configuration of the network was unaffected. On the other hand, a few key hydrogen bonds appear to govern the conformation of the network, and when these bonds are disrupted the network reorganizes. Coulomb interactions within the network report an effective dielectric constant of 20, whereas a dielectric constant of 80 is more consistent with the magnitude of medium to long-range Coulomb interactions in this protein. The data demonstrate that when structures are treated as static, rigid bodies, structure-based pKa calculations with continuum electrostatics method are not useful to treat ionizable groups in cases where pKa values are governed by short-range polar and Coulomb interactions.},

	Abstract = {The {p$K_a$} values measured previously for the internal Lys-66, Asp-66, and Glu-66 in variants of a highly stable form of staphylococcal nuclease are shifted by as many as 5 {p$K_a$} units relative to normal {p$K_a$} values in water. These shifts cannot be reproduced with continuum electrostatics calculations with static structures unless the protein is treated with high dielectric constants near 10. These high apparent dielectric constants are inconsistent with the highly hydrophobic microenvironments of the ionizable moieties in crystal structures. To examine the origins of these high apparent dielectric constants, we showed that the {p$K_a$} values of these internal residues are sensitive to the global stability of the protein; the shifts tend to be smaller in less stable forms of nuclease. This implies that the apparent dielectric constants reported by these internal ionizable groups are high because they reflect conformational reorganization coupled to their ionization. To detect this directly, acid-base titrations monitored with Trp fluorescence and near-UV and far-UV CD spectroscopy were performed on variants with Lys-66, Glu-66, or Asp-66 in background proteins with different stabilities. Conformational reorganization coupled to the ionization of the internal groups was spectroscopically detectable, especially in the less stable background proteins. The data show that to improve the accuracy of structure-based {p$K_a$} calculations of internal groups the calculations will have to treat explicitly all structural reorganization coupled to ionization. The data also suggest a novel approach to mapping the folding free energy landscape of proteins by using internal ionizable groups to stabilize partially unfolded states.},

	Abstract = {Charges are inherently incompatible with hydrophobic environments. Presumably for this reason, ionizable residues are usually excluded from the hydrophobic interior of proteins and are found instead at the surface, where they can interact with bulk water. Paradoxically, ionizable groups buried in the hydrophobic interior of proteins play essential roles, especially in biological energy transduction. To examine the unusual properties of internal ionizable groups we measured the {p$K_a$} of glutamic acid residues at 25 internal positions in a stable form of staphylococcal nuclease. Two of 25 Glu residues titrated with normal {p$K_a$} near 4.5; the other 23 titrated with elevated {p$K_a$} values ranging from 5.2-9.4, with an average value of 7.7. Trp fluorescence and far-UV circular dichroism were used to monitor the effects of internal charges on conformation. These data demonstrate that although charges buried in proteins are indeed destabilizing, charged side chains can be buried readily in the hydrophobic core of stable proteins without the need for specialized structural adaptations to stabilize them, and without inducing any major conformational reorganization. The apparent dielectric effect experienced by the internal charges is considerably higher than the low dielectric constants of hydrophobic matter used to represent the protein interior in electrostatic continuum models of proteins. The high thermodynamic stability required for proteins to withstand the presence of buried charges suggests a pathway for the evolution of enzymes, and it underscores the need to mind thermodynamic stability in any strategy for engineering novel or altered enzymatic active sites in proteins.},

	Abstract = {Pathways of structural relaxation triggered by ionization of internal groups in staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) were studied through multiple self-guided Langevin dynamics (SGLD) simulations. Circular dichroism, steady-state Trp fluorescence, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy have shown previously that variants of SNase with internal Glu, Asp, and Lys at positions 66 or 92, and Arg at position 66, exhibit local reorganization or global unfolding when the internal ionizable group is charged. Except for Arg-66, these internal ionizable groups have unusual pKa values and are neutral at physiological pH. The structural trends observed in the simulations are in general agreement with experimental observations. The I92D variant, which unfolds globally upon ionization of Asp-92, in simulations often exhibits extensive hydration of the protein core, and sometimes also significant perturbations of the ²-barrel. In the crystal structure of the V66R variant, the ²1 strand from the ²-barrel is domain-swapped; in the simulations, the ²1 strand is sometimes partially released. The V66K variant, which in solutions shows reorganization of six residues at the C-terminus of helix $\pm$1 and perturbations in the ²-barrel structure, exhibits fraying of three residues of helix $\pm$1 in one simulation, and perturbations and partial unfolding of three ²-strands in a few other simulations. In sharp contrast, very small structural changes were observed in simulations of the wild-type protein. The simulations indicate that charging of internal groups frequently triggers penetration of water into the protein interior. The pKa values of Asp-92 and Arg-66 calculated with continuum methods on SGLD-relaxed structures reached the normal values in most simulations. Detailed analysis of accuracy and performance of SGLD demonstrates that SGLD outperforms LD in sampling of alternative protein conformations without loss of the accuracy and level of detail characteristic of regular LD.},

	Abstract = {Previously we reported that Lys, Asp, and Glu residues at positions 66 and 92 in staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) titrate with {p$K_a$} values shifted by up to 5 {p$K_a$} units in the direction that promotes the neutral state. In contrast, the internal Lys-38 in SNase titrates with a normal {p$K_a$}. The crystal structure of the L38K variant shows that the side chain of Lys-38 is buried. The ionizable moiety is approximately 7 A from solvent and ion paired with Glu-122. This suggests that the {p$K_a$} value of Lys-38 is normal because the energetic penalty for dehydration is offset by a favorable Coulomb interaction. However, the {p$K_a$} of Lys-38 was also normal when Glu-122 was replaced with Gln or with Ala. Continuum electrostatics calculations were unable to reproduce the {p$K_a$} of Lys-38 unless the protein was treated with an artificially high dielectric constant, consistent with structural reorganization being responsible for the normal {p$K_a$} value of Lys-38. This reorganization must be local because circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy indicate that the L38K protein is native-like under all conditions studied. In molecular dynamics simulations, the ion pair between Lys-38 and Glu-122 is unstable. The simulations show that a minor rearrangement of a loop is sufficient to allow penetration of water to the amino moiety of Lys-38. This illustrates both the important roles of local flexibility and water penetration as determinants of {p$K_a$} values of ionizable groups buried near the protein-water interface, and the challenges faced by structure-based {p$K_a$} calculations in reproducing these effects.},

	Abstract = {The {p$K_a$}s of 96 acids and bases introduced into buried sites in the staphylococcal nuclease protein (SNase) were calculated using the multiconformation continuum electrostatics (MCCE) program and the results compared with experimental values. The {p$K_a$}s are obtained by Monte Carlo sampling of coupled side chain protonation and position as a function of pH. The dependence of the results on the protein dielectric constant (ε(prot)) in the continuum electrostatics analysis and on the Lennard-Jones non-electrostatics parameters was evaluated. The {p$K_a$}s of the introduced residues have a clear dependence on ε(prot,) whereas native ionizable residues do not. The native residues have electrostatic interactions with other residues in the protein favoring ionization, which are larger than the desolvation penalty favoring the neutral state. Increasing ε(prot) scales both terms, which for these residues leads to small changes in {p$K_a$}. The introduced residues have a larger desolvation penalty and negligible interactions with residues in the protein. For these residues, changing ε(prot) has a large influence on the calculated {p$K_a$}. An ε(prot) of 8-10 and a Lennard-Jones scaling of 0.25 is best here. The X-ray crystal structures of the mutated proteins are found to provide somewhat better results than calculations carried out on mutations made in silico. Initial relaxation of the in silico mutations by Gromacs and extensive side chain rotamer sampling within MCCE can significantly improve the match with experiment.

	Abstract = {The origin of the barrier for proton transport through the aquaporin channel is a problem of general interest. It is becoming increasingly clear that this barrier is not attributable to the orientation of the water molecules across the channel but rather to the electrostatic penalty for moving the proton charge to the center of the channel. However, the reason for the high electrostatic barrier is still rather controversial. It has been argued by some workers that the barrier is due to the so-called NPA motif and/or to the helix macrodipole or to other specific elements. However, our works indicated that the main reason for the high barrier is the loss of the generalized solvation upon moving the proton charge from the bulk to the center of the channel and that this does not reflect a specific repulsive electrostatic interaction but the absence of sufficient electrostatic stabilization. At this stage it seems that the elucidation and clarification of the origin of the electrostatic barrier can serve as an instructive test case for electrostatic models. Thus, we reexamine the free-energy surface for proton transport in aquaporins using the microscopic free-energy perturbation/umbrella sampling (FEP/US) and the empirical valence bond/umbrella sampling (EVB/US) methods as well as the semimacroscopic protein dipole Langevin dipole model in its linear response approximation version (the PDLD/S-LRA). These extensive studies help to clarify the nature of the barrier and to establish the reduced solvation effect as the primary source of this barrier. That is, it is found that the barrier is associated with the loss of the generalized solvation energy (which includes of course all electrostatic effects) upon moving the proton charge from the bulk solvent to the center of the channel. It is also demonstrated that the residues in the NPA region and the helix dipole cannot be considered as the main reasons for the electrostatic barrier. Furthermore, our microscopic and semimacroscopic studies clarify the problems with incomplete alternative calculations, illustrating that the effects of various electrostatic elements are drastically overestimated by macroscopic calculations that use a low dielectric constant and do not consider the protein reorganization. Similarly, it is pointed out that microscopic potential of mean force calculations that do not evaluate the electrostatic barrier relative to the bulk water cannot be used to establish the origin of the electrostatic barrier. The relationship between the present study and calculations of pKas in protein interiors is clarified, pointing out that approaches that are applied to study the aquaporin barrier should be validated by pKas calculations. Such calculations also help to clarify the crucial role of solvation energies in establishing the barrier in aquaporins.},

	Abstract = {As stringent tests for the molecular model and computational protocol, microscopic pKa calculations are performed for the key residue, Glu286, in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) using a combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) potential and a thermodynamic integration protocol. The impact of the number of water molecules in the hydrophobic cavity and protonation state of several key residues (e.g., His334, CuB-bound water, and PRDa3) on the Comput. microscopic pKa values of Glu286 has been systematically examined. To help evaluate the systematic errors in the QM/MM-based protocol, microscopic pKa calculations have also been carried out for sites in a soluble protein (Asp70 in T4 lysozyme) and a better-characterized membrane protein (Asp85 in bacteriorhodopsin). Overall, the results show a significant degree of internal consistency and reproducibility that support the effectiveness of the computational framework. Although the number of water molecules in the hydrophobic cavity does not greatly influence the Comput. pKa of Glu286, the protonation states of several residues, some of which are rather far away, have more significant impacts. Adopting the standard protonation state for all titratable residues leaves a large net charge on the system and a significantly elevated pKa for Glu286, highlighting that any attempt to address the energetics of proton transfers in CcO at a microscopic level should carefully select the protonation state of residues, even those not in the immediate neighborhood of the active site. The calculations indirectly argue against the deprotonation of His334 for the proton pumping process, although further studies that explicitly Comput.its pKa are required for a more conclusive statement. Finally, the deprotonated Glu286 is found to be in a stable water-mediated connection with PRDa3 for at least several nanoseconds when this presumed pumping site is protonated. This does not support the proposed role of Glu286 as a robust gating valve that prevents proton leakage, although a conclusive statement awaits a more elaborate characterization of the Glu286?PRDa3 connectivity with free energy simulations and a protonated PRDa3. The large sets of microscopic simulations performed here have provided useful guidance to the establishment of a meaningful molecular model and effective computational protocol for explicitly analyzing the proton transfer kinetics in CcO, which is required for answering key questions regarding the pumping function of this fascinating and complex system.},

	Abstract = {PMID: 18540669 A combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) potential function is used in a thermodynamic integration approach to calculate the pKa of residue 66 in two mutants (V66E, V66D) of Staphylococal nuclease relative to solution. Despite the similarity in chemical nature and experimentally measured pKa of the two buried titritable residues, the behaviors of the two mutants and the Comput. pKa values vary greatly in the simulations. For Glu66, the side chain is consistently observed to spontaneously flip out from the protein interior during titration, and the overall protein structure remains stable throughout the simulations. The Comput. pKa shifts using conventional sampling techniques with multiple nanoseconds per λwindow (Set A and B) are generally close to the experimental value, therefore indicating that large-scale conformational rearrangements are not as important for V66E as suggested by the recent study of Warshel and co-worker. For Asp66, by contrast, flipping of the shorter side chain is not sufficient for getting adequate solvent stabilization of the ionized state. As a result, more complex behaviors such as partial unfolding of a nearby β-sheet region is observed, and the Comput. pKa shift is substantially higher than the experimental value unless Asp66 is biased to adopt the similar configurations as Glu66 in the V66E simulations. Collectively, these studies suggest that the lack of electronic polarization is not expected to be the dominant source of error in microscopic pKa shift calculations, while the need of enhanced sampling is more compelling for predicting the pKa of buried residues. Furthermore, the comparison between V66E and V66D also highlights that the microscopic interpretation of similar apparent pKa values and effective ``dielectric constants''of proteins can vary greatly in terms of the residues that make key contributions and the scale of structural/hydration response to titration, the latter of which is difficult to predict a priori. Perturbative analyses of interactions that contribute to the titration free energy point to mutants that can be used to verify the microscopic mechanisms of titration in V66E/D SNase proteins.},

	Abstract = {<P>Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) is one of the popular linear models in time series forecasting during the past three decades. Recent research activities in forecasting with artificial neural networks (ANNs) suggest that ANNs can be a promising alternative to the traditional linear methods. ARIMA models and ANNs are often compared with mixed conclusions in terms of the superiority in forecasting performance. In this paper, a hybrid methodology that combines both ARIMA and ANN models is proposed to take advantage of the unique strength of ARIMA and ANN models in linear and nonlinear modeling. Experimental results with real data sets indicate that the combined model can be an effective way to improve forecasting accuracy achieved by either of the models used separately.</P>},

	Abstract = {<P>The problem of model uncertainty versus model inaccuracy is examined in the light of the concept of the 'probability of correctness of a model under a given context' introduced by Apostolakis. To avoid possible difficulties linked with this concept, a distinction is introduced between 'predictive' models and 'constitutive' models, the former being generic in the sense that they can host the latter as submodels. A metric or distance between linear models as well as an objective of the model are introduced, from which we can give an operational definition of 'model uncertainty' (with respect to distribution of parameters of the associated constitutive models) and of 'model accuracy' with respect to a reference model. Finally the choice of a predictive model is linked to a loss function and a cost of using or defining a model.</P>},

@article{Carstensen:2011,
	Abstract = {Protein {p$K_a$} calculation methods are developed partly to provide fast non-experimental estimates of the ionization constants of protein side chains. However, the most significant reason for developing such methods is that a good {p$K_a$} calculation method is presumed to provide an accurate physical model of protein electrostatics, which can be applied in methods for drug design, protein design, and other structure-based energy calculation methods. We explore the validity of this presumption by simulating the development of a {p$K_a$} calculation method using artificial experimental data derived from a human-defined physical reality. We examine the ability of an RMSD-guided development protocol to retrieve the correct (artificial) physical reality and find that a rugged optimization landscape and a huge parameter space prevent the identification of the correct physical reality. We examine the importance of the training set in developing {p$K_a$} calculation methods and investigate the effect of experimental noise on our ability to identify the correct physical reality, and find that both effects have a significant and detrimental impact on the physical reality of the optimal model identified. Our findings are of relevance to all structure-based methods for protein energy calculations and simulation, and have large implications for all types of current {p$K_a$} calculation methods. Our analysis furthermore suggests that careful and extensive validation on many types of experimental data can go some way in making current models more realistic.

We use an extension of the leaps-and-bounds algorithm for locating the models that are to be averaged over and make available S-PLUS software to implement the methods. {Bayesian} model averaging provides a posterior probability that each variable belongs in the model, a more directly interpretable measure of variable importance than a P-value. P-values from models preferred by stepwise methods tend to overstate the evidence for the predictive value of a variable and do not account for model uncertainty. We introduce the partial predictive score to evaluate predictive performance. For the Cardiovascular Health Study, {Bayesian} model averaging predictively outperforms standard model selection and does a better job of assessing who is at high risk for a stroke.},

@article{Wang:2004,
	Abstract = {Logistic regression is the standard method for assessing predictors of diseases. In logistic regression analyses, a stepwise strategy is often adopted to choose a subset of variables. Inference about the predictors is then made based on the chosen model constructed of only those variables retained in that model. This method subsequently ignores both the variables not selected by the procedure, and the uncertainty due to the variable selection procedure. This limitation may be addressed by adopting a {Bayesian} model averaging approach, which selects a number of all possible such models, and uses the posterior probabilities of these models to perform all inferences and predictions. This study compares the {Bayesian} model averaging approach with the stepwise procedures for selection of predictor variables in logistic regression using simulated data sets and the Framingham Heart Study data. The results show that in most cases {Bayesian} model averaging selects the correct model and out-performs stepwise approaches at predicting an event of interest.

	Abstract = {A statistical method to predict protein {p$K_a$} has been developed by using the 3D structure of a protein and a database of 434 experimental protein {p$K_a$} values. Each {p$K_a$} in the database is associated with a fingerprint that describes the chemical environment around an ionizable residue. A computational tool, MoKaBio, has been developed to identify automatically ionizable residues in a protein, generate fingerprints that describe the chemical environment around such residues, and predict {p$K_a$} from the experimental {p$K_a$} values in the database by using a similarity metric. The method, which retrieved the {p$K_a$} of 429 of the 434 ionizable sites in the database correctly, was crossvalidated by leave-one-out and yielded root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.95, a result that is superior to that obtained by using the Null Model (RMSE 1.07) and other well-established protein {p$K_a$} prediction tools. This novel approach is suitable to rationalize protein {p$K_a$} by comparing the region around the ionizable site with similar regions whose ionizable site {p$K_a$} is known. The {p$K_a$} of residues that have a unique environment not represented in the training set cannot be predicted accurately, however, the method offers the advantage of being trainable to increase its predictive power. 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Real-world observable physical and chemical characteristics are increasingly being calculated from the 3D structures of biomolecules. Methods for calculating {p$K_a$} values, binding constants of ligands, and changes in protein stability are readily available, but often the limiting step in computational biology is the conversion of PDB structures into formats ready for use with biomolecular simulation software. The continued sophistication and integration of biomolecular simulation methods for systems- and genome-wide studies requires a fast, robust, physically realistic and standardized protocol for preparing macromolecular structures for biophysical algorithms. As described previously, the {PDB2PQR} web server addresses this need for electrostatic field calculations (Dolinsky et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 32, W665-W667, 2004). Here we report the significantly expanded {PDB2PQR} that includes the following features: robust standalone command line support, improved {p$K_a$} estimation via the PRO{p$K_a$} framework, ligand parameterization via PEOE{\_}PB charge methodology, expanded set of force fields and easily incorporated user-defined parameters via XML input files, and improvement of atom addition and optimization code. These features are available through a new web interface (http://{PDB2PQR}.sourceforge.net/), which offers users a wide range of options for PDB file conversion, modification and parameterization.},

	Abstract = {A hybrid protocol combining Rosetta fullatom refinement and Multi-Conformation Continuum Electrostatics (MCCE) to estimate {p$K_a$} is applied to the blind prediction of 94 mutated residues in Staphylococcal nuclease (SNase), as part of the {p$K_a$}-cooperative benchmark test. The standard MCCE method is limited to sidechain conformational changes. The Rosetta refinement protocol is used to add the backbone conformational changes in {p$K_a$} calculations. The non-electrostatic energy component from Rosetta and the electrostatic energy from MCCE are combined to weight the calculated ionization states. Of 63 measured {p$K_a$}s, the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the calculated {p$K_a$}s and the measured values is 4.3, showing an improvement compared to the RMSD of 6.6 in the standard MCCE calculations, using a low protein dielectric constant of 4. The breakdown of {p$K_a$} shift from the solution values (Δ{p$K_a$}) shows that the desolvation energy contributes the most in the standard MCCE calculations. Lowering desolvation penalties and optimizing electrostatic interactions with the Rosetta/MCCE protocol reduces the Δ{p$K_a$} to favor the charged states. Analysis also showed that the Rosetta/MCCE protocol samples conformations with {p$K_a$}s close to the solution values. The question remains whether the correct conformational changes coupled to the ionization changes are found here. Nevertheless, a challenge emerges to accurately estimate the reorganization energy, which is not directly measured from the electrostatic environment of the site of interest. Possible improvements to the protocol are also discussed. Proteins 2011; {\copyright}2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{Rostkowski:2011,
	Abstract = {Charge states of ionizable residues in proteins determine their pH-dependent properties through their {p$K_a$} values. Thus, various theoretical methods to determine ionization constants of residues in biological systems have been developed. One of the more widely used approaches for predicting {p$K_a$} values in proteins is the PRO{p$K_a$} program, which provides convenient structural rationalization of the predicted {p$K_a$} values without any additional calculations. The PRO{p$K_a$} Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a new tool for studying the pH-dependent properties of proteins such as charge and stabilization energy. It facilitates a quantitative analysis of {p$K_a$} values of ionizable residues together with their structural determinants by providing a direct link between the {p$K_a$} data, predicted by the PRO{p$K_a$} calculations, and the structure via the Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) program. The GUI also calculates contributions to the pH-dependent unfolding free energy at a given pH for each ionizable group in the protein. Moreover, the PRO{p$K_a$}-Comput. {p$K_a$} values or energy contributions of the ionizable residues in question can be displayed interactively. The PRO{p$K_a$} GUI can also be used for comparing pH-dependent properties of more than one structure at the same time. The GUI considerably extends the analysis and validation possibilities of the PRO{p$K_a$} approach. The PRO{p$K_a$} GUI can conveniently be used to investigate ionizable groups, and their interactions, of residues with significantly perturbed {p$K_a$} values or residues that contribute to the stabilization energy the most. Charge-dependent properties can be studied either for a single protein or simultaneously with other homologous structures, which makes it a helpful tool, for instance, in protein design studies or structure-based function predictions. The GUI is implemented as a Tcl/Tk plug-in for VMD, and can be obtained online at http://pro{p$K_a$}.ki.ku.dk/~luca/wiki/index.php/GUI_Web.},

	Abstract = {Modeling charge interactions is important for understanding many aspects of biological structure and function, and continuum methods such as Finite Difference {Poisson}-Boltzmann (FDPB) are commonly employed. Calculations of pH-dependence have identified separate populations; surface groups that can be modeled with a simple Debye-H{\"u}ckel (DH) model, and buried groups, with stronger resultant interactions that are dependent on detailed conformation. This observation led to the development of a combined FDPB and DH method for {p$K_a$} prediction (termed FD/DH). This study reports application of this method to ionizable groups, including engineered buried charges, in staphylococcal nuclease. The data had been made available to interested research groups before publication of mutant structures and/or {p$K_a$} values. Overall, FD/DH calculations perform as intended with low Δ{p$K_a$} values for surface groups (RMSD between predicted and experimental {p$K_a$} values of 0.74), and much larger Δ{p$K_a$} values for the engineered internal groups, with RMSD = 1.64, where mutant structures were known and RMSD = 1.80, where they were modeled. The weaker resultant interactions of the surface groups are determined mostly by charge-charge interactions. For the buried groups, R(2) for correlation between predicted and measured Δ{p$K_a$} values is 0.74, despite the high RMSDs. Charge-charge interactions are much less important, with the R(2) value for buried group Δ{p$K_a$} values increasing to 0.80 when the term describing charge desolvation alone is used. Engineered charge burial delivers a relatively uniform, nonspecific effect, in terms of {p$K_a$} . How the protein environment adapts in atomic detail to deliver this resultant effect is still an open question. Copyright {\copyright} 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	Abstract = {{p$K_a$} calculation methods that are based on finite difference solutions to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (FDPB) require that energy calculations be performed for a large number of different protonation states of the protein. Normally, the differences between these protonation states are modeled by changing the charges on a few atoms, sometimes the differences are modeled by adding or removing hydrogens, and in a few cases the positions of these hydrogens are optimized locally. We present an FDPB-based {p$K_a$} calculation method in which the hydrogen-bond network is globally optimized for every single protonation state used. This global optimization gives a significant improvement in the accuracy of calculated {p$K_a$} values, especially for buried residues. It is also shown that large errors in calculated {p$K_a$} values are often due to structural artifacts induced by crystal packing. Optimization of the force fields and parameters used in {p$K_a$} calculations should therefore be performed with X-ray structures that are corrected for crystal artifacts.

Although computational algorithms have been developed for calculating everything from the dynamics of a protein to its binding specificity, only limited information is available on the ability of these methods to give accurate results when used with a particular X-ray structure. We examine the ability of a {p$K_a$} calculation algorithm to predict the proton-donating residue in the catalytic mechanism of hen egg white lysozyme. We examine the correlation between the ability of the {p$K_a$} calculation method to obtain the correct result and the overall characteristics of 41 X-ray structures such as crystallization conditions, resolution, and the output of structure validation software. We furthermore examine the ability of energy minimizations (EM), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and structure-perturbation methods to optimize the X-ray structures such that these give correct results with the {p$K_a$} calculation algorithm. We propose a set of criteria for identifying the proton donor in a catalytic mechanism, and demonstrate that the application of these criteria give highly accurate prediction results when using unmodified X-ray structures. More specifically, we are able to successfully identify the proton donor in 85{\{}{\%}{\}} of the X-ray structures when excluding structures with crystal contacts near the active site. Neither the use of the overall characteristics of the X-ray structures nor the optimization of the structure by EM, MD, or other methods improves the results of the {p$K_a$} calculation algorithm.

To better understand these results, 21 additional sets of predictions were performed with the same program, varying the internal dielectric, reference {p$K_a$}, partial charge set, and dielectric boundary. The internal dielectric (ε(p)) and dielectric boundary were the two most important factors contributing to the quality of the predictions. Although the lowest overall errors were observed with a molecular dielectric boundary at ε(p) = 8, predictions using a smooth Gaussian dielectric boundary performed almost as well at lower ε(p) values because the Gaussian boundary implicitly accounts for a significant level of solvent penetration. Improved {p$K_a$} predictions with the Gaussian boundary methodology will require better prediction and modeling of structural changes due to changes in ionization state, perhaps without resorting to the more exhaustive sampling of conformational states used by other recent continuum methods.

Unfortunately, it often fails to find narrow cavities inside a protein. As a consequence {p$K_a$} computations based on this algorithm perform badly. In this study a new cavity-algorithm is introduced, which solves this problem and provides improved {p$K_a$} values. The procedure is applied to 20 {p$K_a$} values of titratable groups introduced as point mutations in SNase variants, where crystal structures are available. The computations of these {p$K_a$}s are particular challenging, since they are placed in a rather hydrophobic environment. For nine mutants, where the titratable residue is in contact with a large cavity, the RMSD({p$K_a$}) between Comput. and measured {p$K_a$} values is 2.04, which is a considerable improvement as compared to the original results obtained with Karlsberg(+) (http://agknapp.chemie.fu-berlin.de/karlsberg/) that yielded an RMSD({p$K_a$}) of 8.8. However, for 11 titratable residues the agreement with experiments remains poor (RMSD({p$K_a$}) = 6.01). Considering 15 {p$K_a$}s of SNase, which are in a more conventional less hydrophobic protein environment, the RMSD({p$K_a$}) is 2.1 using the SASA-algorithm and 1.7 using the new cavity-algorithm. The agreement is reasonable but less good than what one would expect from the general performance of Karlsberg(+) indicating that SNase belongs to the more difficult proteins with respect to {p$K_a$} computations.

	Abstract = {Accurate predictions of {p$K_a$} values of titratable groups require taking into account all relevant processes associated with the ionization/deionization. Frequently, however, the ionization does not involve significant structural changes and the dominating effects are purely electrostatic in origin allowing accurate predictions to be made based on the electrostatic energy difference between ionized and neutral forms alone using a static structure and the subtle structural changes be accounted by using dielectric constant larger than two. On another hand, if the change of the charge state is accompanied by a large structural reorganization of the target protein, then the relevant conformational changes have to be explicitly taken into account in the {p$K_a$} calculations. Here we report a hybrid approach that first predicts the titratable groups whose ionization is expected to cause large conformational changes, termed "problematic" residues, and then applies a special protocol on them, while the rest of the {p$K_a$}s are predicted with rigid backbone approach as implemented in multi-conformation continuum electrostatics (MCCE) method. The backbone representative conformations for "problematic" groups are generated with either molecular dynamics simulations with charged and uncharged amino acid or with ab-initio local segment modeling. The corresponding ensembles are then used to calculate the titration curves of the "problematic" residues and then the results are averaged to obtain the corresponding {p$K_a$}.

	Abstract = {Accurate computational methods of determining protein and nucleic acid {p$K_a$} values are vital to understanding pH-dependent processes in biological systems. In this article, we use the recently developed method constant pH molecular dynamics (CPHMD) to explore the calculation of highly perturbed {p$K_a$} values in variants of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase). Simulations were performed using the replica exchange (REX) protocol for improved conformational sampling with eight temperature windows, and yielded converged proton populations in a total sampling time of 4 ns. Our REX-CPHMD simulations resulted in calculated {p$K_a$} values with an average unsigned error (AUE) of 0.75 pK units for the acidic residues in Δ+ PHS, a hyperstable variant of SNase. For highly {p$K_a$}-perturbed SNase mutants with known crystal structures, our calculations yielded an AUE of 1.5 pK units and for those mutants based on modeled structures an AUE of 1.4 pK units was found. Although a systematic underestimate of pK shifts was observed in most of the cases for the highly perturbed pK mutants, correlations between conformational rearrangement and plasticity associated with the mutation and error in {p$K_a$} prediction was not evident in the data. This study further extends the scope of electrostatic environments explored using the REX-CPHMD methodology and suggests that it is a reliable tool for rapidly characterizing ionizable amino acids within proteins even when modeled structures are employed.

	Abstract = {A constant pH molecular dynamics method has been used in the blind prediction of {p$K_a$} values of titratable residues in wild type and mutated structures of the Staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) protein. The predicted values have been subsequently compared to experimental values provided by the laboratory of Garc{\'\i}a-Moreno. CpHMD performs well in predicting the {p$K_a$} of solvent-exposed residues. For residues in the protein interior, the CpHMD method encounters some difficulties in reaching convergence and predicting the {p$K_a$} values for residues having strong interactions with neighboring residues. These results show the need to accurately and sufficiently sample conformational space in order to obtain {p$K_a$} values consistent with experimental results.

	Abstract = {Proton uptake or release controls many important biological processes, such as energy transduction, virus replication, and catalysis. Accurate {p$K_a$} prediction informs about proton pathways, thereby revealing detailed acid-base mechanisms. Physics-based methods in the framework of molecular dynamics simulations not only offer {p$K_a$} predictions but also inform about the physical origins of {p$K_a$} shifts and provide details of ionization-induced conformational relaxation and large-scale transitions. One such method is the recently developed continuous constant pH molecular dynamics (CPHMD) method, which has been shown to be an accurate and robust {p$K_a$} prediction tool for naturally occurring titratable residues. To further examine the accuracy and limitations of CPHMD, we blindly predicted the {p$K_a$} values for 87 titratable residues introduced in various hydrophobic regions of staphylococcal nuclease and variants. The predictions gave a root-mean-square deviation of 1.69 pK units from experiment, and there were only two {p$K_a$}'s with errors greater than 3.5 pK units. Analysis of the conformational fluctuation of titrating side-chains in the context of the errors of calculated {p$K_a$} values indicate that explicit treatment of conformational flexibility and the associated dielectric relaxation gives CPHMD a distinct advantage. Analysis of the sources of errors suggests that more accurate {p$K_a$} predictions can be obtained for the most deeply buried residues by improving the accuracy in calculating desolvation energies. Furthermore, it is found that the generalized {Born} implicit-solvent model underlying the current CPHMD implementation slightly distorts the local conformational environment such that the inclusion of an explicit-solvent representation may offer improvement of accuracy.

	Abstract = {{p$K_a$} calculations based on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation have been widely used to study proteins and, more recently, DNA. However, much less attention has been paid to the calculation of {p$K_a$} shifts in RNA. There is accumulating evidence that protonated nucleotides can stabilize RNA structure and participate in enzyme catalysis within ribozymes. Here, we calculate the {p$K_a$} shifts of nucleotides in RNA structures using numerical solutions to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. We find that significant shifts are predicted for several nucleotides in two catalytic RNAs, the hairpin ribozyme and the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme, and that the shifts are likely to be related to their functions. We explore how different structural environments shift the {p$K_a$}s of nucleotides from their solution values. RNA structures appear to use two basic strategies to shift {p$K_a$}s: (a) the formation of compact structural motifs with structurally-conserved, electrostatic interactions; and (b) the arrangement of the phosphodiester backbone to focus negative electrostatic potential in specific regions.},

	Abstract = {In the past few decades, many ingenious efforts have been made in the development of free-energy simulation methods. Because complex systems often undergo nontrivial structural transition during state switching, achieving efficient free-energy calculation can be challenging. As identified earlier, the ``Hamiltonian''lagging, which reveals the fact that necessary structural relaxation falls behind the order parameter move, has been a primary problem for generally low free-energy simulation efficiency. Here, we propose an algorithm by achieving a random walk in both the order parameter space and its generalized force space; thereby, the order parameter move and the required conformational relaxation can be efficiently synchronized. As demonstrated in both the alchemical transition and the conformational transition, a leapfrog improvement in free-energy simulation efficiency can be obtained; for instance, (i) it allows us to solve a notoriously challenging problem: accurately predicting the {p$K_a$} value of a buried titratable residue, Asp-66, in the interior of the V66E staphylococcal nuclease mutant, and (ii) it allows us to gain superior efficiency over the metadynamics algorithm.},

	Abstract = {Internal ionizable groups in proteins are relatively rare but they are essential for catalysis and energy transduction. To examine molecular determinants of their unusual and functionally important properties, we engineered 25 variants of staphylococcal nuclease with lysine residues at internal positions. Nineteen of the Lys residues have depressed {p$K_a$} values, some as low as 5.3, and 20 titrate without triggering any detectable conformational reorganization. Apparently, simply by being buried in the protein interior, these Lys residues acquired {p$K_a$} values comparable to those of naturally occurring internal ionizable groups involved in catalysis and biological H+ transport. The {p$K_a$} values of some of the internal Lys residues were affected by interactions with surface carboxylic groups. The apparent polarizability reported by the {p$K_a$} values varied significantly from location to location inside the protein. These data will enable an unprecedented examination of the positional dependence of the dielectric response of a protein. This study also shows that the ability of proteins to withstand the presence of charges in their hydrophobic interior is a fundamental property inherent to all stable proteins, not a specialized adaptation unique to proteins that evolved to depend on internal charges for function.},

	Abstract = {Prior computational studies of the acid-unfolding behavior of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) suggest that the {p$K_a$} values of its carboxylic groups are difficult to reproduce with electrostatics calculations with continuum methods. To examine the molecular determinants of the {p$K_a$} values of carboxylic groups in SNase, the {p$K_a$} values of all 20 Asp and Glu residues were measured with multidimensional and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy in an acid insensitive variant of SNase. The crystal structure of the protein was obtained to describe the microenvironments of the carboxylic groups. Fourteen Asp and Glu residues titrate with relatively normal {p$K_a$} values that are depressed by less than 1.1 units relative to the normal {p$K_a$} of Asp and Glu in water. Only six residues have {p$K_a$} values shifted by more than 1.5 units. Asp-21 has an unusually high {p$K_a$} of 6.5, which is probably the result of interactions with other carboxylic groups at the active site. The most perturbed {p$K_a$} values appear to be governed by hydrogen bonding and not by Coulomb interactions. The {p$K_a$} values calculated with standard continuum electrostatics methods applied to static structures are more depressed than the measured values because Coulomb effects are exaggerated in the calculations. The problems persist even when the protein is treated with the dielectric constant of water. This can be interpreted to imply that structural relaxation is an important determinant of the {p$K_a$} values; however, no major pH-sensitive conformational reorganization of the backbone was detected using NMR spectroscopy.},

	Abstract = {This paper treats the free energy contribution of ionizable groups to protein stability. A method is presented for the calculation of the pH dependence of the denaturation free energy of a protein, which yields results that can be compared directly to experiment. The first step in the treatment is the determination of the average charges of all the ionizable groups in both the folded and unfolded protein. An expression due to Tanford then relates the pH dependence of the unfolding free energy to the difference in net charge between the two states. In order to determine absolute rather than relative unfolding free energies, it is necessary to calculate the total contribution of ionizable groups to protein stability at some reference pH. This is accomplished through statistical mechanical treatment similar to the one used previously in the calculation of {p$K_a$}s. The treatment itself is rigorous but it suffers from uncertainties in the {p$K_a$} calculations. Nevertheless, the overall shape of experimentally observed plots of denaturation free energy as a function of pH are reasonably well reproduced by the calculations. A number of general conclusions that arise from the analysis are ; (1) knowledge of titration curves and/or effective {p$K_a$} values of ionizable groups in proteins is sufficient to calculate the pH dependence of the denaturation free energy with respect to some reference pH value. However, in order to calculate the absolute contribution of ionizable groups to protein stability, it is necessary to also know the intrinsic {p$K_a$} of each group. This is defined as the {p$K_a$} of a group in a hypothetical state of the protein where all other groups are neutral. (2) Due to desolvation effects, ionizable groups destabilize proteins, although the effect is strongly dependent on pH. There are however, strongly stabilizing pairwise Coulombic on the surface of proteins. (3) Plots of stability versus pH should not be interpreted in terms of a group whose {p$K_a$} corresponds to the titration midpoint, but rather to a group with different {p$K_a$}s (that correspond approximately to the titration end points) in each state. (4) Any residual structure in the GuHCl-denatured state of proteins appears to have little effect on the pH dependence of stability. (5) pH-dependent unfolding, for example to the "molten globule" state, appears due to individual groups with anomalous {p$K_a$}s whose locations on the protein surface may determine the nature of the unfolded state.},

However, compared to other ensemble techniques such as bagging and boosting, BOC is less known and rarely used in data mining. This is partly due to BOC being perceived as being inefficient and because bagging and boosting consistently outperforms a single model, which raises the question: ``Do we even need BOC in datamining?''. We show that the answer to this question is ``yes'' by illustrating several recent efficient model averaging approximations to BOC can significantly outperform bagging and boosting in realistic situations such as extensive class label noise, sample selection bias and many-class problems. That model averaging techniques outperform bagging and boosting in these situations has not been published in the machine learning, mining or statistical communities to our knowledge.},

	Abstract = {The {p$K_a$} Cooperative (http://www.{p$K_a$}coop.org) was organized to advance development of accurate and useful computational methods for structure-based calculation of {p$K_a$} values and electrostatic energies in proteins. The Cooperative brings together laboratories with expertise and interest in theoretical, computational, and experimental studies of protein electrostatics. To improve structure-based energy calculations, it is necessary to better understand the physical character and molecular determinants of electrostatic effects. Thus, the Cooperative intends to foment experimental research into fundamental aspects of proteins that depend on electrostatic interactions. It will maintain a depository for experimental data useful for critical assessment of methods for structure-based electrostatics calculations. To help guide the development of computational methods, the Cooperative will organize blind prediction exercises. As a first step, computational laboratories were invited to reproduce an unpublished set of experimental {p$K_a$} values of acidic and basic residues introduced in the interior of staphylococcal nuclease by site-directed mutagenesis. The {p$K_a$} values of these groups are unique and challenging to simulate owing to the large magnitude of their shifts relative to normal {p$K_a$} values in water. Many computational methods were tested in this first Blind Prediction Challenge and critical assessment exercise. A workshop was organized in the Telluride Science Research Center to objectively assess the performance of many computational methods tested on this one extensive data set. This volume of Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics introduces the {p$K_a$} Cooperative, presents reports submitted by participants in the Blind Prediction Challenge, and highlights some of the problems in structure-based calculations identified during this exercise.
